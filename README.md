# Technical AI Project

## Overview

This project serves as a central repository for AI-related technical documentation, experiments, and shared utilities. It aims to support various AI initiatives by providing a common ground for resources and best practices.

## Key Areas

* **Documentation:** Standards, guidelines, and architectural overviews.
* **Experiments:** Proof-of-concept implementations and research findings.
* **Utilities:** Shared scripts, tools, and configurations.

## Technologies & Conventions

* **Primary Language:** Python for AI/ML tasks, TypeScript for any web-related utilities.
* **Documentation Format:** Markdown for all documentation files.
* **Version Control:** Git, following conventional branching models (e.g., GitFlow or similar).
* **Linting/Formatting:** Prettier for Markdown and TypeScript, Black/Flake8 for Python (or as per specific sub-project needs).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `yarn install` (for TypeScript) or `pip install -r requirements.txt` (for Python)
3. **Run tests:** `yarn test` (TypeScript) or `pytest` (Python)
4. **Build the project:** `yarn build` (TypeScript) or follow Python-specific build steps
5. **Start development server:** `yarn dev` (TypeScript) or use a Python server (e.g., Flask, Django)

## Contributing

* Follow the conventions in `codingconventions.md`.
* Update `README.md`, `codingconventions.md`, and `codeupdates.md` with every significant change.
* Prefer updating and improving files over creating new ones.
